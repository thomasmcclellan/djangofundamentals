# Django is a free and open source web framework
# It is used by many sites, including Pinterest, PBS, INstagram, BitBucket, Washington Times, Mozilla, etc.

# Allows us to solve two major problems:
# Map a requested URL from user to the code that's actually meant to handle it
# Create requested HTML dynamically

# Using templates, we can actually inject from a database to a page for the user

# Because the original developers were surrounded by writers (created in newspaper), good written documentation is a key part of Django
# This means you have excellent references to check on the official Django docs

# USE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS!!!
